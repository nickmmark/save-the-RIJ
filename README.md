should intensivists routinely place central lines in the right internal jugular or save that site for potential future lines?

### Save the RIJ? – Central Line Risk Calculator
This interactive web calculator helps clinicians decide whether to place a central venous catheter (CVC) in the right internal jugular (RIJ) immediately or reserve it for potential future hemodialysis (HD) line placement in ICU patients.

Users can enter custom complication rates for CVC and HD line placement by site, as well as the estimated probability of requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The app compares two strategies:

Use the RIJ now:
```
Risk = (CVC complication rate for RIJ) + (Probability of CRRT × HD line complication rate for LIJ)
```

Save the RIJ for HD:
```
Risk = (CVC complication rate for LIJ) + (Probability of CRRT × HD line complication rate for RIJ)
```

Results are expressed as complications per 100 patients and a recommendation is given based on which strategy yields the overall lower risk.
